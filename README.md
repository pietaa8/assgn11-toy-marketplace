Welcome to the ToysStore client-side repository! This repository contains the frontend code for the ToysStore website. Below you will find some key information about the project.

Project Overview:
ToysStore is a toy marketplace website where users can buy and sell toys online. The platform provides a seamless experience for users to browse, search, and interact with toys listed on the marketplace. Users can also add their own toys to sell and manage their toy inventory.

Project Features:

3.Add Toy: Authenticated users can add their own toys to sell. They can provide information such as the toy name, description, category, price, and upload images of the toy.

4.My Toy Page: Authenticated users have a dedicated "My Toy" page where they can manage their listed toys. They can view, edit, and delete their listed toys as needed.

5.All Toys Page: The "All Toys" page showcases all the toys available on the marketplace. Users can explore and interact with toys listed by other sellers.
